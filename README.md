<h1>Confectionery Castle</h1>

<p>The goal of this project was to create an website using the Django framework containing several applications. I chose to create my own project, rather than follow the brief, and I decided to build a website that allows users to register and purchase baked goods from a bakery, leave reviews and make suggestions for things they would like to see added. A user can purchase any number of items from the store. There is also a statistics page where users can see which products are the most popular, which suggestions have the most upvotes and see how far along the suggestions are via their progress status.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>

<h3>User Stories</h3>

    <li>As a user, I would like to be able to register an account and be able to view my profile.</li>
    <li>As a user, I would like to be able to view products and purchase any number of them.</li>
    <li>As a user, I would like to be able to leave a review and give my feedback on the products I purchased, my experience using the site etc.</li>
    <li>As a user, I would like to be able to leave a suggestion as to what I think would a be a great addition/improvement to the site/product selection.</li>
    <li>As a user, I would like to be able to comment on other people's reviews/suggestions to say whether I agree or disagree with them.</li>
    <li>As a user, I would like to be able to upvote suggestions that I think would be beneficial.</li>
